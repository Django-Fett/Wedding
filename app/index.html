							<p class="details">
								<strong class="flag">Born in Chicago, raised in Pittsburgh, Daniel spent the majority of his formative years in the arts.</strong>
								<br/>
								<br/>
								As computing advanced at a breath-taking pace, during the dot-com boom, he quickly developed an interest technology. This curiousity ultimately led him to the University of Pittsburgh where he studied Computer Science and Japanese.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Following the dot-com bust, Daniel decided that it was time to set his sights onto greener pastures - and move back to Chicago.  Since then, Daniel has worked for several notable tech firms including Aon Hewitt, eNeighborhoods, Orbitz.com, and Nextag.com.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								He is currently serving as a Sr. User Experience Engineer for The Textura Corporation.

								Love in the Club?
							</p>
							<p class="details">
								<strong class="flag"> The night before Thanksgiving, affectionately known as Black Wednesday, </strong>
								has been hailed as a good time to party so Tyler and her friend, Angelica, made their way to the Shrine on November 23, 2010, to check out one of their favorite group, Tribe Called Quest (sans Q-Tip The Abstract) guest deejay.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								It was during the performance, Daniel approached Tyler and the two began chatting and danced the night away.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Love at first sight? Absolutely. The pair had their first date a week later and became exclusive a month after. Months later Break Up To Make Up became the soundtrack of their lives.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Despite their differences, Tyler always loved Daniel’s confidence, intelligence and genuineness. And Daniel was drawn by Tyler's creativity, passion, and determination.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Fast forward three years later, filled with memorable excursions along with a realization the two were truly meant for each other, Daniel proposed to Tyler on September 29, 2013.

From those times when I was her teacher (Ms. Nelson), to helping her when it was time to go off to college, there are countless experiences that we've had that are so memorable.
									<br/>

									Now that Tyler is entering into the next phase of her life, I'm sure that she'll be teaching me a thing or two as she has throughout our lives.  Wishing the best for Tyler and Dan!

									Anyways, we are truly like brothers to the fullest.

									I wish the best of everything for you, now and forever.  Remember, a happy marriage is a long conversation that always seems too short.

									I didn’t want to make friends with the dude who was correcting the instructor and was apparently coding better than him.
									But, I noticed we shared a lot in common from the way we were raised, our dedication to education, our struggles to break stereotypes, our passion for all things Japan, our undying love of the Steelers, to our utter lack of fashion sense and game with women.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									A lot has happened since, but I can proudly say being Dan’s friend has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.
